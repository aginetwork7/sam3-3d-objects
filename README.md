# 3D Model Generation from a Single Image

This repository is a **demo project** that showcases how to generate and visualize a **3D model from a single input image**.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline, from image input to 3D visualization in a web interface.

---

## 🚀 Overview

- Input a **single image**
- Generate a **3D model** from the image
- **Visualize** the generated 3D model directly in the browser

Currently, the project uses the **Fal API** for 3D model generation.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **3D Generation**: Fal API  
- **Frontend**: Web-based 3D visualization  
- **Backend**: API-based inference pipeline  

---

## 📌 Current Status

- ✅ Single-image to 3D model generation
- ✅ Basic web visualization
- ⚠️ Demo-level UI and rendering quality

---

## 🧩 TODO

### 1. Refine the Webpage

- Improve UI/UX for clearer and more polished results
- Enhance lighting, camera controls, and rendering quality
- Add loading states and error handling
- Display side-by-side comparison (input image vs generated 3D model)

### 2. Deploy the Model Locally

- Remove dependency on the Fal API
- Deploy the 3D generation model locally
- Add setup instructions for local inference
- Optimize performance for local CPU/GPU environments

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Support multiple input images or viewpoints
- Export models in multiple formats (OBJ, GLB, STL)
- Add mesh cleanup and texture refinement
- Compare outputs from different 3D generation models

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is intended for **demonstration and experimentation purposes only** and is not production-ready.
